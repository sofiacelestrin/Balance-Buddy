## Coin Reward System Proposal

Here’s a simpler, rule-based system for earning coins based on task complexity, completion, and overall balance:

1. Task Completion Rewards: Users earn coins when they complete tasks, with coin rewards based on task complexity.

- Coin Reward Formula: coins earned = complexity \* 2
  For example, completing a complexity 3 task rewards 3 \* 2 = 6 coins.

2. Balance-based Bonuses: If all well-being meters (health, self-actualization, happiness, social connection) are within 10% of each other (indicating good balance), users receive a bonus multiplier on task completion rewards.

   - Balanced Task Bonus: Multiply the base coin reward by 1.5 if the player’s meters are balanced.

3. Penalty for Imbalance: When a user completes a task with one or more meters significantly lower than others (20% or more difference), the coin reward decreases by half. This incentivizes balancing neglected areas before continuing.

This system rewards task completion based on effort while promoting well-being balance.
