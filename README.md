# Task-Farmers

Implement a full stack web app that functions as a gamified task manager. It is inspired by the
app Finch, but with a few different twists. Essentially you complete your own user-defined tasks
to earn in-app rewards. If it were farming themed, for instance, completing your real-life
homework would earn you the chance to buy virtual chickens for your farm. You also would
have limited energy in a day for tasks, so you canâ€™t overbook yourself.
