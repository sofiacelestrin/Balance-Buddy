# Balance Buddy
Balance Buddy is a gamified task management system designed to help users balance productivity and self-care. The app encourages users to maintain equilibrium across different areas of their lives, inspired by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Users can complete real-life tasks, earn coins, and customize their virtual avatar, which reflects their well-being through dynamic wellness meters.

## Description
Balance Buddy addresses the shortcomings of existing task management apps by promoting balance across key areas of life: health, happiness, social connection, and self-actualization. Users are incentivized to complete tasks in these categories to maintain their avatar's wellness meters, which deplete daily based on an algorithm. The app is built using modern web technologies and offers an engaging user experience with colorful interfaces and interactive features.
